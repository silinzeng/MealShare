# Meal Time
An app developed for WE HACK to minimize restaurant food waste by connecting businesses to buyers. 
Businesses can post on our website to announce available leftover meals at a discounted price. 
Future integrations include either a text notification subscription, a mobile app, meal reservations, review options, meal availability updates, and area based alerts.
